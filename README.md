Fuck windows.

I used to be a windows scrub, then I spent a full day trying to get c++ to fucking compile on it.

Fuck you Bill.

And there are STILL unitialized pointers

But at least now I can see them

And hate them

Fuck.

FUCK SLEEP

THE DAY WE TRANSCEND THIS USELESS FUCKING MORTAL BODY WILL BE THE DAY I ACTUALLY GET SHIT DONE

FUCK EATING TOO

AND SHITTING
