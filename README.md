Fuck windows.
I used to be a windows scrub, then I spent a full day trying to get c++ to fucking compile on it.
Fuck you Bill.
And there are STILL unitialized pointers
But at least now I can see them
And hate them
Fuck.

FUCK SLEEP
THE DAY WE TRANCEND THIS USELESS FUCKING MORTAL BODY WILL BE THE DAY I ACTUALLY GET SHIT DONE
FUCK EATING TOO
